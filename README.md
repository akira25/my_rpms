# Akira25's personal RPMs

This repository holds the specfiles for some RPMs, that I packaged primarily for
personal usage. Usually, I build them irregularly via the `./build.sh` script
and push them to my [copr-Account](https://copr.fedorainfracloud.org/coprs/mhuebner/).

If you find them useful, you might install them from there. Please mind, that this
project is a private initiative only. I do not maintain the software packaged by
these files.

Special care needs to be taken with the `next`-packages. These follow the main
branch of the sources directly. Please consider, that this might leed to using
bleeding-edge software, containing bugs.
